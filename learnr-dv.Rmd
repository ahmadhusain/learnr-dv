## Chap.1: Basic Knowlegde

### Data Science Workflow

**Data science** is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data [(Dhar, 2013 )](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/12/169933-data-science-and-prediction/abstract). There is a certain workflow that applied in a data science project. Below is a good chart that explains the **workflow of a data science project** from a book by *Grolemund & Wickham*, titled [R for Data Science](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/r-for-data/9781491910382/preface01.html).

### The Grammer of Graphics 

The `ggplot2` package is created by Hadley Wickham in 2005 as an implementation of Lelad Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. The idea with Grammar of Graphics is to create a formal model for data visualization, by breaking down graphics into components that could be systematically added or subtracted by the end user.

With `ggplot2`, plots may be created using `qplot()` where arguments and defaults are handled similarly to the base plotting system, or through `ggplot()` where user can add or alter plot components layer-by-layer with a high level of modularity.

The latter is more important approach, because it allows the data scientists to work with plots in a system that breaks up these different tasks. Instead of a huge, conceptually flat list of parameters to control every aspect of the plot’s final outcome, this system makes plotting a series of distinct task, each focused on one aspect of the plot’s final output.


## Chap.2: Data Visualization in Context

Visualization is a powerful way to deliver a context from our data. If we could choose a good way to communicate our context, our audience will get the insight that we want to deliver.

* Categorical ranking
  - bar plot (`geom_bar` / `geom_col`)
  - lollipop plot (`geom_segment`)
* Data distribution
  - Histogram plot (`geom_hist`)
  - Density plot (`geom_density`)
* Correlation between data
  - Scatter plot (`geom_point`)
* Map and geospatial
  - leaflet
  
Good reference to leads you to the most appropriate graph for your data [data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) We will cover the basic way to visualize using the **attrition** dataset.

```{r read-data}
data_attrition <- read.csv("data_input/data-attrition.csv")
head(data_attrition)
```

## Chap.2.1: Categorical Ranking

Categorical ranking is one of the most basic ways to communicate how our categorical variable could show a different behaviour between its levels in terms of a numerical output.

The aggregation steps has been done to save your time to visualize the context and named `data_viz`.

```{r data-agg1, echo=FALSE}
# aggregation
data_agg <- data_attrition %>% 
  group_by(education_field) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()

# prepare visualization data
data_viz <- data_agg %>% 
  mutate(
    education_field = education_field %>%
      str_replace_all("_", " ") %>% 
      str_to_title(),
    education_field = reorder(education_field, -n),
    n_percent = round(n / sum(n), 2),
    label = glue("{n} ({n_percent} %)")
  ) %>% 
  select(education_field, n, label)

head(data_viz)
```

### Exercise-1

*For a starter, let’s try to see the ranking of `education_field` in terms of number of employee. **Use `data_viz` object and `geom_col()`**!*

```{r exercise-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

*Congratulation on your first plot. Can you imagine how to replicate the following plot?*

```{r data-viz1, echo=FALSE}
# visualize
ggplot(data_viz, aes(x = education_field, y = n)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = n)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), nudge_y = 25) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of employee",
    subtitle = "reported from a batch of employee by education fields",
    caption = "Source: IBM Watson",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Exercise-2

*Drag and drop for the appropriate way to replicate the plot above:*

```{r parsons-1, echo=FALSE}
question_parsons(
  initial = c(
    "labs(...)",
    "geom_col(aes(fill = n))",
    "summarize(...)",
    "aggregate(...)",
    "ggplot(data_viz, aes(x = education_field, y = n))",
    "geom_text(aes(label = label), nudge_y = 25)",
    "guides(fill = FALSE)",
    "theme_minimal()"
    
  ),
  pass_if(
    c(
      "ggplot(data_viz, aes(x = education_field, y = n))",
      "geom_col(aes(fill = n))",
      "geom_text(aes(label = label), nudge_y = 25)",
      "guides(fill = FALSE)",
      "labs(...)",
      "theme_minimal()"
    )
  ),
  
  fail_if(
    ~length(.) < 6,
    message = "Include six answers"
  ),
  
  fail_if(
    function(x){"summarize(...)" %in% x},
    message = "You should not include summarize(...) in your answer"
  ),
  
  fail_if(
    function(x){"aggregate(...)" %in% x},
    message = "You should not include aggregate(...) in your answer"
  )
)
```

### Exercise-3

*From exercise above try to create your solution here:*

```{r exercise-2, exercise=T, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```


## Chap.2.2: Data Distribution

Data distribution is a, slightly statistical, way to see how our numerical data distributed inside our sample dataset. One thing that should be noted for this visualization: **it only works for continuous numerical variable**.

*let’s see how monthly income is distributed between the employees if we use 30 bins:*


```{r data-viz2, echo=FALSE}
# visualize
ggplot(data_attrition, aes(x = monthly_income)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "dodgerblue4", colour = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = dollar_format(scale = 1e-3, suffix = "K")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of employee by monthly income distribution",
    subtitle = "count value calculated using 30 bins",
    caption = "Source: IBM Watson",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Exercise-5

*Using `data_attrition`, could you replicate the plot above?*

```{r exercise-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

Let’s try another plot by splitting the monthly income distribution by department and attrition:

```{r data-viz3, echo=FALSE}
# prepare visualization data
data_viz <- data_attrition %>% 
  mutate(
    department = department %>%
      str_replace_all("_", " ") %>% 
      str_to_title() %>% 
      str_replace_all("Research Development", "Research & Development"),
    department = reorder(department, monthly_income),
    attrition = attrition %>% 
      str_to_title() %>% 
      factor(levels = c("Yes", "No"))
  )

head(data_viz)
```


```{r data-viz4, echo=FALSE}
# visualize
ggplot(data_viz, aes(x = department, y = monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = attrition), outlier.shape = NA) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(scale = 1e-3, suffix = "K")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#883844", "#208eb7")) +
  labs(
    title = "Monthly income distribution",
    subtitle = "for each department",
    caption = "Source: IBM Watson",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    fill = "Attrition",
    colour = "Attrition"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```

### Exercise-6

*Using `data_viz`, could you replicate the plot above?*

```{r exercise-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# your code here:

```

### Exercise-4

*From exercise above try to answer this question*:

```{r sortable-1, echo=FALSE}
# Define the answer options
insects <- c(
    "Human Resources",
    "Research & Development",
    "Sales"
  )

# Initialize the question
question_rank(
  "Sort these departement which have strongest difference in income distribution",
  answer(insects, correct = TRUE),
  answer(rev(insects), correct = FALSE, message = "Other direction!"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Chap.2.3: Correlation between Data

* Between continuous variables

The most common form of correlation is between continuous numerical variables. It could show us if the two variables are sharing a variation patterns, which oftenly, very insightful to explaining our dataset.

__*let’s try to visualize how years at company relate to the monthly income for laboratory technicians samples.*__

```{r data-viz5, echo=FALSE}

# aggregation
data_agg1 <- data_attrition %>% 
  filter(job_role == "laboratory_technician") %>% 
  group_by(years_at_company) %>% 
  summarise(monthly_income = median(monthly_income)) %>% 
  ungroup()

head(data_agg1)

```

### Exercise-7

*Try to aggregating `data_attrition` become the table above, and named it as `data_agg1`*

```{r exercise-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```


```{r data-viz8}
# visualize
ggplot(data_agg1, aes(x = years_at_company, y = monthly_income)) +
  geom_point(colour = "dodgerblue4") +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "darkred") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(scale = 1e-3, suffix = "K")) +
  labs(
    title = "The relation of years at the company and monthly income",
    subtitle = "using median value from laboratory technician samples",
    caption = "Source: IBM Watson",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```


As we can see from plot above, there is a relation between years at the company with the monthly income; the longer an employee stay at the company, his/her salary is tend to increase. But `geom_smooth()` here is playing a crucial role in explaining the relation. From the smoothed line, we could see that the relation is not always linear; there is a downturn after 10 years at the company, before it rising again after 17-19 years.


__*how about years at company relate to the monthly income for sales executive samples?*__


```{r data-viz9, echo=FALSE}
data_agg2 <- data_attrition %>% 
  filter(job_role == "sales_executive") %>% 
  group_by(years_at_company) %>% 
  summarise(monthly_income = median(monthly_income)) %>% 
  ungroup()

head(data_agg2)
```

```{r data-viz10}
# visualize
ggplot(data_agg2, aes(x = years_at_company, y = monthly_income)) +
  geom_point(colour = "dodgerblue4") +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "darkred") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(scale = 1e-3, suffix = "K")) +
  labs(
    title = "The relation of years at the company and monthly income",
    subtitle = "using median value from sales executive samples",
    caption = "Source: IBM Watson",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

__*After take a look at two plots above, can you answer the following question?*__

```{r exercise-8, echo=FALSE}
question(
  text = "which job role that have strong relationship between years at the company towards monthly income?", 
  type = "single",
  correct = "Great!", 
  incorrect = "Opps!", allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  answer("Sales Executive", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Laboratory Technician")
)
```
